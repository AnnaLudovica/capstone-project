# #Anxiety on social media 
 A study on how mental health issues such as anxiety is shared on Twitter

## Introduction
Many studies have pointed out how anxiety affects the life of many people from different generations, and in particular Millennials (American Psychiatric Association,2018; Abel, Buff, Burr, 2016; Docu, 2018; Stephens-Davidowitz, 2016) and how there is some sort of a stigma about mental health issues (APA, 2018). It is, therefore, interesting to look at how menthal health related experiences are shared on social media.

## Goal of the research
This research aims to inspect how people talk about mental health on Twitter, and, in particular, about *anxiety*. It will be based on tweets that contain the hashtags #anxiety and #mentalhealth to understand how these two topics are discusses on social media.
